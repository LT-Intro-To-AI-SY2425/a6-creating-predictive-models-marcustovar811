# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?

The r squared value is the correlation value of the model which is 0.62 I would say this tells us that the model isn't the best it could be, since the highest value is 0.99 and that's the value where the correlation is greatest. 

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?

136.5, according to my model when I check the value for 42 years old. 

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

In my opinion, the model's predictions are less accurate because its r-squared value is low. However, it might still be good enough to predict someone's blood pressure based on their age, since the actual blood pressure is close to what the model predicts. To improve the model we could try to increase the correlation value with more accurate data.
