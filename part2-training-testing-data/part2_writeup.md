# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?


This model is more accurate because it provides a better view of the data, including the training data, testing data, and the predicted data. Also, it showws the process of splitting our data.


2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?

It shows how accurate the model is, and for me, it was 63% or 0.63. This means the model is somewhat good at making predictions.


3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.

I would say this model is definitely more accurate. Looking at the line on the graph you can spot a difference, and the r^2 value shows the same thing. However, I wouldn't say this is ready for real-world use yet, because it might not be as accurate for larger scale datasets.
